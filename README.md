# Updated Myhas Recipe List 2017
Use with https://github.com/myshak/ss13recipemanager 
Anyone is free to update effects of chemicals, as I have not checked them. I have only changed their recipes to be current.

Anyone is free to update the recipe list, provided they follow the format and these rules:
1. Absolutely no secret chemical recipes. Listing them with hints is fine, but don't give the recipe.
2. On top of above, don't make up your own secret hints. Use the wiki's.
3. Don't include precursors for secret recipes unless they are already on the wiki.

Also I am terrible at github
